# Knockout
Based on GamePigeon's Knockout

Description: In this game, there are two teams of seals on an icy platform. The goal is to knock all the opposing team's seals off of the platform. During the planning phase, drag arrows from your seals to determine where they'll slide during the action phase, hopefully knocking off some enemies. In the 2-Player mode, pass the computer to whoever is currently in the planning phase so the other player can't see where you plan to slide your seals. In the bot mode, a bot will automatically play against you. Feel free to also play around with settings like friction, speed, and mass to switch up some of the game physics!

Run Instructions: The user should install CMU graphics and run the knockout.py file in an editor.
