# Knockout
Based on GamePigeon's Knockout

Video Demo: https://youtu.be/6wyiJ6-qGYU

Description: Battle it out on an icy platform as two teams of seals face off! The objective is simple: knock all of the opposing team's seals off the platform. During the Planning Phase, drag arrows from your seals to determine the direction and speed they should slide. Then, watch them slide into action in the Action Phase, with the hopes of sending enemy seals flying! In the 2-Player mode, pass the computer to whoever is currently in the planning phase to keep your strategies hidden. In the bot mode, challenge a bot opponent that will plan its own moves. Feel free to also play around with settings like friction, speed, and mass to switch up some of the game physics and create new gameplay dynamics!

Run Instructions: The user should install CMU graphics and run the knockout.py file in an editor.
